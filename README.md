This organization gathers work done on RooFit in a collaboration of the Netherlands eScience Center, Nikhef, DIANA HEP and CERN.

From the Netherlands eScience Center side, two projects were funded in this collaboration:
- The ["Automated Parallel Computation of Collaborative Statistical Models"](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/projects/automated-parallel-calculation-of-collaborative-statistical-models/) project with Wouter Verkerke (Nikhef): making RooFit faster by adding parallelized gradient computations to minimization.
- The "ROOFIT: Optimized parallel calculation of complex likelihood fits of LHC data" project with Ivo van Vulpen (Nikhef): optimizing the previously added framework and extending it with parallelized second derivative calculation.
